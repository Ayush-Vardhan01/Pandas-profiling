This project demonstrates how to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset using the `pandas-profiling` library in Python. It generates a detailed profiling report of the data, which can help you understand the datasetâ€™s structure, patterns, and potential issues.

## Features
- Automated profiling of datasets
- Detailed statistics (e.g., missing values, unique values, correlations)
- HTML report generation for interactive EDA
- Easy-to-read visualizations for quick insights

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- `pandas
- `pandas-profiling
